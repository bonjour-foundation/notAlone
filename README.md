# NotAlone

The app that won't leave you alone.

## Getting Started

Many people who are alone or see their mobility restricted depend on support: housework, care, listening, shopping, taking out rubbish. Being alone can affect the mood. Family and friends are worried. Volunteers want to help.

NotAlone makes it easy for those in need to organize themselves with relatives, friends and helpers and to keep them up to date.
